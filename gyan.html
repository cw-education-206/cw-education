              <h4>Privilege in Educational Spaces</h4>
              <p>The project shows the struggle of a student who belongs to a different background. The first day the protagonist said no, when her friends decided to go to the dhaaba. This was because she realized that she did not have enough money to eat at the dhaaba and did not want her friends to pay for her. The friends sat together at the dhaaba and interacted while the protagonist went back to the library to read something.
<br/>
The second day, again at the dhaaba, the protagonist and her friends decided to order lemonade. One of the friends requested the dhaaba owner to give her some credit, which was granted to her. When our protagonist came and requested for the same, the dhaaba owner said no. During my research, in one of the readings we found out how students were discriminated against in local dhaaba in the University of Hyderabad. This is what we saw here as well. Later, when our protagonist went back, she found that her friends were discussing a web series. She starts talking about Gullak, a Hindi web series on SonyLiv. Her friends dismissed her recommendation and started talking about the English web series again, resulting in her disconnecting from the conversation. This is a common theme which we find in many such instances in college campuses.
<br/>
I had also thought about interviewing a few people for the same. One of the persons whom I asked for the interview, rejected to appear for the same. One of them said that in the past few days many people had come up to her for the same. “This is the reason why people talk to me, so I cannot help.”
