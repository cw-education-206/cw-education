              <p>As part of the course ‘Education, Literacy, and Justice’, where we talked about pedagogy and social change in equal measure, a certain question was inevitably prioritised: how do we make pedagogy effect social change? Unfortunately, much of what we study and research in the university is exclusively curated for specialised audiences. Further, the process of working and researching itself is often too individualised and isolating, and focussed on producing a narrow idea of an academic document. Instead, should we not take on the challenge of producing knowledge in collaborative, dialogic, and more accessible ways, to engage with existing communities and build newer ones? </p>

				<p>The public pedagogy project is an attempt to translate the perspectives of the final papers written by the batch into creative presentations for a diverse non-academic public. For many, the process towards developing the project entailed interactions and activities with different groups of people, to both learn from them as well as involve them in the project. The result has been diverse and wide-ranging, from podcasts to infographics to community workshops to fiction and documentary videos. Hope you like them!</p>

The idea is to express how messy complicated and conflicting grief can be and how it easily shifts from one feeling or mental state to the other. The movements are meant to be simple and abstract so that the viewer can attach their own meaning and interpretation. Some movements are more overt in nature like the banging of wrists against the door, meant to express frustration and denial. While others like the frames with just the feet and hands are more subtle expressions of tension and longing. For example, the opening frame with the movement of the heel and toes signifies the initial shock of the loss. The inability to maintain balance expresses a sense of uncertainty and confusion. Towards the end, there is a feeling of hope and the desire to find acceptance and release.">The video demonstrates the experience of grief through movement.

When the majority of the discussions around dialogue focus on students, there exists very limited spaces for teachers to open up. Even in academic writing, everything found related to the topic is mainly what a teacher should do and not what students should. So, my public pedagogy initiative revolves around initiating dialogues with students and teachers. As part of it, I have started doing a series called The Dialogue Series, which will have various episodes regarding dialogue. The first episode was the students' perspective video. The purpose of this episode is to make students aware of the need for spaces and opportunities for teachers to freely open up about the difficulties that they face while teaching.">Dialogue is a crucial determinant in a student-teacher interaction.

                <p title="notions of shame, embarrassment and untalentedness mediate our relationship with the activity of singing. Where does this idea—that I can not sing, or I am not good enough of a singer to be singing in front of others—come from? Through my research, I’ve found, as scholars of singing pedagogy before me have, that one of the sources of this anxiousness is the way we have been taught music in schools. My public pedagogy project aims to convey the crux of my research using two methods. I offer a short video version of my paper, covering a bit of the research process and the main findings. I also offer a song that I have written, and performed. In it, I talk about how insecurities about our singing abilities are common, but they shouldn’t stop us from engaging in singing altogether. Singing, after all, is a human tradition, sustained through centuries, linking individual to individual, and community to community. I sing this song to the tune of ‘Ever Since New York’ by Harry Styles, one of the first songs that I found the courage to sing in public.">“Remember when we’d sing, just for the love of it?”

In my experience working as an elementary teacher, I was able to leverage art education to facilitate an engaging classroom environment. Students started to participate more in class and share their insights. Additionally, they started to collaborate with one another and build upon their teamwork skills. I was able to witness the impact created on students’ socio-emotional development with the way they would empathize with one another and encourage their peers. I believe that artists can bring out something that cannot be seen or felt easily and can start a dialogue with the viewer. An art piece can generate multiple meanings and help one make conceptual connections. I aim to showcase this through my public pedagogy project and also propose interactive and playful methods of teaching, that can act as an alternative to the static instructional practices.">Art is one of the first forms of visual expression and language in children.

It also provided people with a safe space for them to mentally drift to when their current life circumstances seemed difficult to handle. Even though daydreaming as an activity has some valid criticisms, it cannot be denied that it certainly does spark creativity and aids in innovation. While indulging in daydreaming, it is important to assess whether it is helping in providing a desirable outcome, professionally or emotionally or whether it is making one simply loom over negative thoughts and unpleasant life experiences. In order to not let daydreaming come in the way of one's productivity, one has to be able to exercise some levels of self reflection to understand if the time spent on daydreaming was fruitful and if not, exercise a deliberate intervention.

The aim of this dictionary is to inspire curiosity and consciousness by providing short engaging descriptions on ideas related to self, living and its different components, in this version, mainly three- self, relationships and big picture thinking. It is imperative that you as a reader see words in the context they are in- for instance, boundaries in the section of love and relationships would specifically talk about boundaries in that context as opposed to boundaries of knowledge, physical boundaries around one’s house etc. A last word of caution- unlike a conventional dictionary’s attempt at objectivity, this one has a bias. You will often find that the information given favors a particular viewpoint more than others. This is because I believe that a bias towards sensitivity and rationale is a bias worth ascribing to.">This dictionary is an attempt at helping us learn a language that allows us to have better relationships with who we are and those around us.
