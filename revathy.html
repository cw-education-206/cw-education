              <h4>Human Rights Training Modules For The People Who Are Away From Schools</h4>
              <p>What is the actual aim of human rights education in India if the people who should be the primary recipients of it are denied access to it?- This question led me to the idea of this project.My public Pedagogy project aims at the creation of brief  human rights training modules that are in the form of interactive write ups for communities around us who have not been able to access formal schooling.While doing my final project, I came across the fact that most of the human rights education initiatives in India are overdependent on the formal education setup. Most of it is planned and executed through higher education spaces such as the universities. This leads to a vital proportion of the population who are socio-economically disadvantaged, missing out on human rights training and awareness, as they are systematically denied access to formal education spaces and usually drop out at school level.
<br/>
This project is my very humble attempt on the path to bridge this gap. It first involved the identification of various communities around me who might not have had access to formal education, especially any form of human rights training.Then  I tried creating a sample module which is simple and handy for one sub category and tried its impact first hand.As I found those to be very useful and informative for the targeted community, I replicated the model to create more more communities.Even though this attempt is very limited, I have been able to explore a whole new area the utility of non-formal education spaces and techniques to impart human rights education and thus, it's very close to my heart.
